# Useful Scripts

This repo contains several useful scripts.

**rgasearch.sh**. A shell script that runs [ripgrep all](https://github.com/phiresky/ripgrep-all) and [fuzzy finder](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf) to search PDFs in a local directory. I use this to search through my 2,800 (and counting) RPG PDFs which sit in an /RPGs/ directory. Requires both Ripgrep All and Fuzzy Finder to be installed aind in the user's path.

**Markdown to PDF**. This directory contains a shell script, a latex template, and instructions for setting up a Mac automator application to generate a PDF from a markdown file. I use this with my session notes in Obsidian which I can then print and use at the table in my physical three-ring notebook.

**PDF to ePub**. This directory contains a script for converting PDFs to ePub using pdftotext and pandoc, both of which must be installed. It has its own separate readme.
